## SorgsCraft
SorgsCraft is a mod that adds members of the Discord group that was originally brought together by Grigs in Brane Sorgs.
### Features
Currently there are 5 items in the game, which don't have a lot of uses. It's planned for there to be items and mobs for several of the current and past members of the group.

The current items are:
- Br3ad's Gap, which can be used as a helmet
- The Tooth of the Goblin, which can be used to acquire The Gap
- Grease Block, a block of WD40 harvested directly from unchilled
- Grease Drop, an item that can be used to craft Grease Blocks
- Aaralyn's Homework, an item that signifies the utter stupidity of Aaralyn

### History
**The Brane Sorgs Era**

Grigs brought together the original Brane Sorgs with him, Blythe and Br3ad being the core members. It was those 3 members that brought in all the others.

Br3ad brought in unchilled, Tripp, Toxik, rob, Rafi, and later would bring in Minty and Ava.

Blythe brought in all of the hood gangsters that he knew back in Chicago.

Grigs brought in Rob and all the Xotic members that would later start to become more intertwined with the Discord. And most importantly he brought in Larcas, Blythe, and Br3ad who brought all the others.

However, Brane Sorgs was not a perfect Discord. The administration was rather abusive, and tended to hoard power and allow those with power to do as they please. Because of this, people stopped liking the server as much.

After a few months of being there, unchilled had snuck a Discord bot into the server. With this bot, he held complete power over the server, and they didn't realize it.

Because unchilled didn't care whatsoever about Brane Sorgs, he allowed Br3ad to use the bot in order to completely nuke Brane Sorgs. 

When Brane Sorgs was nuked, there was temporarily a time where there was no server. A few days later, Grigs created Brane Sorgs Reunited. He even allowed unchilled and Br3ad to return.

When the start of school came, unchilled and Br3ad needed a place to store Japanese notes. So they made a new server called Japan. It was originally meant to be nothing but a private server, but a few people were invited to it so they would know where unchilled and Br3ad were during school.

Pretty soon, the majority of the group members were in both Brane Sorgs Reunited and Japan at the same time. Over time, more and more people started to regularly use Japan. And less and less people were using Brane Sorgs Reunited.

Eventually Brane Sorgs Reunited had hardly anybody using it anymore. Somebody would use it maybe once every 3 days or so. For whatever reason, unchilled had been granted low-level power in Brane Sorgs Reunited. Grigs didn't seem to realize that he had given unchilled the ability to delete Brane Sorgs.

Since nobody was using it, unchilled finalized the transition to Japan by deleting Brane Sorgs.

**The Rise and Fall of Japan**

Since Br3ad owned Japan, he entrusted only unchilled with power. Everybody else had no power at all. While it still was a complete tyranny, it was better than Brane Sorgs.

However, it wasn't always perfect. Br3ad became power-obsessed. He began using his power on his slightest whim, deafening or muting people for no reason at all. Because he owned the Discord, he maintained power over most things. He became addicted to having power.

When someone is addicted to having power, you can imagine what happens when they lose it. It was a downward spiral for Br3ad.

Br3ad decided to make a Minecraft server. He used a simple hosting website, and opened it up for the whole Discord. Immediately, war began to break out on the Minecraft Server. unchilled was an experienced Minecraft player, and he teamed with Blythe and Rob, and they became immensely powerful in the server.

Br3ad became desperate. He started to recruit more members for his team and even resorted to cheating in order to find unchilled's base. When he announced he was on the way to their base, unchilled, Rob, and Blythe had to find a way to get to him first.

It ended up being the fact he recruited whoever he could that would be his downfall. unchilled's team was so far ahead they simply offered for Larcas to join them and be given full diamond gear, and all Larcas had to do was tell them Br3ad's coordinates.

Once they had Br3ad's coordinates, they ambushed him as he was leaving his base. Immediately the whole group dug into Br3ad's underground base and started spawn killing them and looting them. Br3ad's team was reduced to nothing.

Because Br3ad's team was reduced to nothing, the Discord decided to reset the Minecraft server and start over. However, Br3ad wanted to feel power. He was still bitter over being destroyed in Minecraft by the other team, so he decided to use as much power as he had.

Since he was the admin of the server, he started spawning creepers near players, resulting in them being killed and being unable to mine. After this went on for a few minutes, the whole Discord was mad at Br3ad. Everyone decided to leave Japan and instead use EGOTOPIA, a server owned by Blythe.

**EGOTOPIA**

Blythe was by far the best ruler so far. He didn't abuse power, and he remained the sole admin for the entire time he owned the Discord. Since nobody else had power, nobody was being abused.

This was a prosperous time for the Discord. Many people were brought into the group, and the group grew closer as a result of not having massive power abuse all the time. No one person held power over the entire dynamic of the group, so it stayed peaceful and respectful.

Egotopia lasted several months, but eventually Br3ad became hungry for power again. He created Blossoms. He originally said it was just a server for his close friends, but he slowly started to bring more and more people in. All he had to do was get some core members of the group to join him.

Once he got the most central members of the Discord to join him, his server started to overtake Egotopia. He eventually even got Blythe himself to switch to Blossoms.

**Blossoms Power Struggle**

As soon as nobody was using Egotopia anymore, Br3ad went back to abusing power. Rob was the main victim of this, but others were targeted as well. 

It went on for a couple of months, but eventually people got fed up with it again. So to keep people in his server, he temporarily transfered power to Rob, and made him promise to give the power back when everyone had cooled down.

So everyone went back, with Rob as the temporary owner. But that night, unchilled attempted to bribe Rob into giving him power instead. Br3ad told Rob that if he sold the server to unchilled, he would DM all of Rob's instagram friends as much weird stuff as possible.

Rob didn't want to do it, but then unchilled responded by saying that if Rob didn't sell the server, unchilled would send pictures of Br3ad to Br3ad's crush. That meant that Br3ad would DM Rob's followers because Rob would have indirectly caused this.

Rob folded under pressure, and transferred ownership of the server to Blythe. Since then, Blythe has been the owner of Blossoms, and all has been peaceful. Still, nobody uses Egotopia, but Blythe is the same ruler he was for Egotopia.

This is the current state of the Discord. If anything can be learned from this, it can be summed up in one sentence.

**Sic semper tyrannus**
